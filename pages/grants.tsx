                Potential beneficiaries of the Popcorn Foundation must be nominated by the Popcorn Foundation or by
                POP token holders through a multi-step beneficiary nomination process. The Foundationâ€™s granting activity is
                focused but not limited to the following areas:  environmental, educational, inequality,
                and open-source initiatives. Once beneficiaries are accepted, they can then apply for a grant.
                Grants are delivered in three fixed-term durations: 1 month, 3 months, and 12 months.
